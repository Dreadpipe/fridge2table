# Fridge2Table
The app that helps get your food fresh from your fridge to your table.

## Overview and Goals
Fridge2Table has one overarching goal - to make the modern problem of food management smooth and efficient all the way from when you first bring your food home until you eat it. 
In achieving this goal, Fridge2Table will give users the ability to track their food wherever they store it with expiration dates and regular notifications if their food sits unused for too long. Our users will be able to make and store recipies, and see which recipes they can make with the food thay have. If they're missing food from their home inventory, our users will be able to automatically or manually create shopping lists with new items and items populated from their inventory, past and present. 

Every feature of our app has the singular goal of enhancing the food management experience for our users, and we intend to make that experience great.

## Deployment 
Our app will be deployed on Android and IOS phones, and our database will be hosted on AWS - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
